Module: Capnp.ById
Description: Machine-addressable aliases for modules generated by the schema compiler.

In addition to modules with human readable names, the schema compiler also generates
modules of the form @Capnp.ById.X\<schema id\>@. These are used internally by generated
code, so that generated modules with dependencies on other schema don't have to know
what the human-readable names of those schema are -- they import by id.

Each module in this heirarchy just re-exports everthing from the module with
a human-readable name.

This hierarchy is an implementation detail that most users don't need to know
about.
